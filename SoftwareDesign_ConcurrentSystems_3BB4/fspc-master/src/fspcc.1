.SH NAME
fspcc \- An FSP compiler and LTS analysis tool

.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command invokes an Finite State Process (FSP) compiler and a
Labelled Transition System (LTS) analysis tool.
.PP
The FSP language can be used to model concurrent systems, e.g.
multi-threaded/multi-process applications. An FSP model can be
compiled into a graph-based representation using an FSP compiler:
each FSP process is transformed into an equivalent LTS.
.PP
An LTS analysis tool is then able to:
.RS 3
.IP "   -"
detect concurrency problems in the concurrent system (e.g. deadlock,
starvation)
.RE
.RS 3
.IP "   -"
show that certain properties (or assertions) hold on the concurrent system
.RE
.RS 3
.IP "   -"
run a simulation (animation) of the concurrent system, in order to gain
confidence on the model
.RE
.PP
When invoked in the first form, you use the \fI-i\fR option to specify an
input file containing FSP definitions. The tool will compile all the FSP
models, and produce an output file containing the corresponding compiled LTSs.
.PP
When invoked in the second form, you use the \fI-l\fR option to specify a
file containing a set of compiled LTSs, in order to use the LTS analysis
tool without compiling again.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-i\fR \fIPATHNAME\fR
.RS 3
Specifies an input file pathname containing FSP definitions to compile.
.RE

.PP
\fB\-o\fR \fIPATHNAME\fR
.RS 3
Specifies the output file pathname where compiled LTSs are stored. If this
option is not specified, the default output file name is 'output.lts'.
.RE

.PP
\fB\-l\fR \fIPATHNAME\fR
.RS 3
Specifies the input file pathname containing compiled LTSs.
.RE

.PP
\fB\-d\fR
.RS 3
Runs deadlock/error analysis on every compiled LTS. A list of deadlocks/errors
will be printed on the standard output. If there are no such problems, no
output is produced.
.RE

.PP
\fB\-p\fR
.RS 3
Runs all the specified progress checks on every compiled LTS. A list of
progress violations will be printed on the standard output. If there are no
such problems, no output is produced.
.RE

.PP
\fB\-g\fR
.RS 3
Outputs a GraphViz representation file corrisponding to every LTS.
For each process named 'P', a file called 'P.gv' is created.
.RE

.PP
\fB\-a\fR
.RS 3
The same as \fB\-dpg\fR.
.RE

.PP
\fB\-s\fR
.RS 3
Runs an LTS analysis interactive shell. The shell is run after compilation
(if any), but before the compiled output is generated (if any).
.RE

.PP
\fB\-S\fR \fIPATHNAME\fR
.RS 3
Runs the LTS analysis script specified by the pathname. The script is
run after the compilation (if any) but before invoking the interactive shell
(when \fB\-s\fR is specified).
.RE

.PP
\fB\-D\fR \fINUMBER\fR
.RS 3
Specifies the maximum accepted depth for process references. This is
mainly useful to avoid problems with poorly written recursive processes.
Example of a problematic process, which causes unterminated recursion:
.PP
.RS 4
P(K=3) = if (K == 0) then END else P(K-1);P(K-2);END.
.RE
.RE

.PP
\fB\-v\fR
.RS 3
Show versioning information.
.RE

.PP
\fB\-h\fR
.RS 3
Show the help.
.RE


.SH EXAMPLES
Here is a simple example of FSP input file (say in.fsp):
.PP
.RS 4
P = (a->b->P|c->d->END).
.br
Q = (t[i:1..2]-> (when (i>1) u->Q | v->Q)).
.br
||C = (P || Q).
.RE
.PP
Compile these FSP models and store the result into 'out.lts'
.PP
.RS 4
fspcc -i in.fsp -o out.lts
.RE
.PP
Now run all the analysis and produce GraphViz representations
.PP
.RS 4
fspcc -a -l out.lts
.RE
.PP
Alternatively, you can do the same thing with just one command
.PP
.RS 4
fspcc -a -i in.fsp -o out.lts
.RE
.PP
To launch an interactive shell
.PP
.RS 4
fspcc -s -i in.fsp
.RE
.PP
or, from a compiled LTS file
.PP
.RS 4
fspcc -s -l out.lts
.RE
